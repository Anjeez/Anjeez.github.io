Some programming languages I made
<h1>Yumefuck/Dreamfuck</h1>
<p>A turing tarpit (though the computational class isn't rigorously proven). It has a single memory cell and an infinite tape of cells</p>

<p>a adds m to the current cell<br>
s moves the pointer left<br>
d moves the pointer right<br>
f puts the number in memory into the pointer cell, and clears memory<br>
g gets number from input and stores it in the current cell<br>
h does the cryptoleq operation O1(m,k)  x^-1ymod59051 (if the value is 59049 or 59050, it sets to 0)<br>
j put number into the memory cell, but does not clear the pointer cell<br>
k performs the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge#Crazy_operation">crazy operation</a> between the memory and the pointer cell<br>
l outputs the current cell as a character from Unicode. Does not clear the pointer cell<br>
; puts pointer back m instructions if the pointer cell is zero. Does not clear the memory cell</p>
<p>All other symbols are no-ops. It is also case insenitive, so A and a both add</p>

<h1>Beerlang</h1>
<p>A machine that prints out beer programs and nothing else</p>

<p>Programs are of this form</p>

<p>
b0 = <a style="color:#808080;">{The initial amount of bottles. If left blank, then the program takes user input}</a><br>
halt = <a style="color:#808080;">{If the current number of bottles reaches this point, then the program stops}</a><br>
<a style="color:#808080;">{This part is the main part of the program used to calculate the next }</a>

</p>

<p>To end the verse, you use the sing keyword in this form:<br>
sing <a style="color:#808080;">{Number of bottles}</a><br>
By default, this would print "Take <a style="color:#808080;">{Current number minus new value}</a> down, pass it round" if the new value is less than the current, or "Place <a style="color:#808080;">{New value minus current value}</a> down, go to town" is greater. If you want to change it, you use this<br>
sing "<a style="color:#808080;">{The new verse, with the formula of the new number of bottles surrounded by braces in the place of the correspondning line}</a>"<br>
If the iteration is run without hitting the sing keyword, then the default is the current number of bottles minus one.<br>

<p>Valid keywords</p>
<p>i b &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp|Default variables. i is the current verse number (starting from 0) and b is the current number of bottles<br>
= &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp|Used to assign and define new variables. You are unable to assign a new value to with i, b0, halt or b (except with the use of sing)<br>
+ - * / % &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp|Arithmetic operations<br>
if else end &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp|Flow control. End is used to end if statements<br>
== != > >= < <=|Comparison<br>
and or &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp|Booleans<br>
sing &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp|See above</p>
<p> You are also allowed to use parentheses to reduce ambiguity</p>

<h2>Traditional Beer Program</h2>
<p>
b0 = 99<br>
halt = 0<br>
sing b-1

<h2>Output</h2>
99 bottles of beer on the wall<br>
99 bottles of beer<br>
Take 1 down, pass it round<br>
98 bottles of beer on the wall<br>
<br>
<a style="color:#808080;">...</a><br>
<br>
2 bottles of beer on the wall<br>
2 bottles of beer<br>
Take 1 down, pass it round<br>
1 bottle of beer on the wall<br>
<br>
1 bottle of beer on the wall<br>
1 bottle of beer<br>
Take 1 down, pass it round<br>
No more bottles of beer on the wall<p>

<h2>Truth Machine</h2>
<p>
b0 =<br>
halt = 0<br>
sing b

<h2>Fibonacci Numbers</h2>
<p>
b0 = 1<br>
halt = -1<br>
if i == 0<br>
&nbsp a = 0<br>
&nbsp sing b<br>
end<br>
c=b+a<br>
a=b<br>
sing c</p>
