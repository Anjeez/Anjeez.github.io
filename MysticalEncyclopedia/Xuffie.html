      <a style="color:#CCFFFF;"><b>Xuffie</b></a> is a deutagonist or protagonist of Mystical Mermaid Melody. She is the keeper of the X Crystal.
      <br>
      <h2>Appearance and personality</h2>
      Xuffie is a golden haired girl with blue eyes. She has blue fairy-like wings that she can hide. Her usual outfit consists of a white dress.
      <br>
      <br>
      Her idol outfit consists of a white dress with a short skirt and light blue ruffles and golden lace that act as straps, as well as gloves and boots similar to everyone elses. Unlike the other mermaid princesses, her microphone is cross shaped as her "pearl" is not like the others.
      <br>
      <br>
      Xuffie is kind hearted and always looks out for everyone else. Apparently, she has a dark past that caused her too get an X-shaped scar on her back. She has a crush on <a href="http://anjeez.github.io/MysticalEncyclopedia/Ikuma.html" style="color:#330000">Ikuma</a>. She also is very kind on the viewers, filling them on information that they otherwise wouldn't know if they haven't watch the source material
      </p>
      <h2>Some more facts brought to you by Anjeez929</h2>
      She is apparently <a href="http://anjeez.github.io/MysticalEncyclopedia/Lucia.html" style="color:#FF00FF">Lucia</a>'s adopted daughter.
      <br>
      <br>
      Her name is derived from a fanfic featuring Hanon.
      <br>
      <br>
      She is almost entirely based on the letter X, from her name, to her design, even to her favourite items (Chocolate in Nahuatl is "XocolƒÅtl", and Watermelon is also known as Xigua).
