<h1>T3-Y - Hints Here: Explained</h1>
<p>Every curse in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA9aEeIcU28">Yangsy's new No Hints Here String Curse</a></p>
<p>Note that this will use my personal symbols for the curses instead of the symbols that Yangsy uses</p>

<h2>Beginning</h2>
<h3>B3<a style="color:#F00">+</a>Y: Thanks for Playing my game but each pair of identical tiles will be played once</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Oncer</p>
<p><b>Edited from:</b> Each tile will be played twice</p>
<p>If there are two tiles in a row with the same angle, then the second tile is removed.</p>
<h3>12-Y: Artificial Chariot but the acute angles and the obtuse angles are swapped</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> ObAcu</p>
<p>From Yangsy's website: The angle of each tile is now its supplementary angle. Integer multiples of 180° will bypass this curse, while angles >180° will be moduled by 180° when processing. This effect can also add or removing twirls without changing the rhythm for better readability.</p>

<h2>T3-1 - Warm up!!!</h2>
<h3>8-XC: Jungle City but every angled section has an extra beat</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Crab Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Angler</p>
<p>When each stretch of straight line is not parallel to the line of on-beat, then an extra straight tile is added.</p>

<h2>T3-2 - Squares, holds and midspins</h2>
<h3>12-X*: Artificial Chariot but there are too many squares</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Landmine Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> LANDMINE XII SQUARE</p>
<p>Squares are added to right angles (both 90° and 270°).</p>

<h2>T3-3 - Don't miss qing a shot!!!</h2>
<h3>6-XAZC: PULSE but two tiles but triple planet tiles</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Miss Qing Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Tripler</p>
<p>The thing is charted like it's three planets, however only two planets are there, kind of like an inverse of T4 Crab curse and XN String curse.</p>
<h3>2-Y: Offbeats but it is in three-four time</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Commoner</p>
<p>Except now for some reason it's in 22/24 time. The official description for this curse is "It is in another type of rhythm"</p>

<h2>T3-4 - Tricky Trialgens!!</h2>
<h3>8-X∇: JungleCity.zip</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Carrot Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Carrot.zip</p>
<p>It's compressed. Id est, all straight tiles are removed and replaced with a pause that lasts as long as the stretch of straight tiles</p>


<h2>T3-5 - High Pings!!</h2>
<h3>4-XXX: File lost?</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> XXX Curse</p>
<p>Okay, I don't really have names for the XXX curses. Anyways, it's just like 8-X Carrot curse except the disappearances of straight tiles corrupts the music</p>

<h2>T3-6 - Collect Undefined!!</h2>
<h3>T3-Y: Hints Here</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Constraint</p>
<p>Apparently, this just removes uncertain factors like freeroam. The entire freeroam section is skipped</p>
<h3>4-X*: Love Letters but when the angle is 90°, it is double</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Landmine Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> LANDMINE IV DOUBLE</p>
<p>Exactly what it says in the tin. (Almost. This also includes 270°). This curse happens at the same time as...</p>
<h3>MN-Y: Night Wanderer (cnsouka remix) but no midspins found in this level</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Nospin</p>
<p>From Yangsy's website: Replace each midspin to non-midspin tiles, without changing the rhythm.</p>


<h2>T3-7 - Remember this, this, AND THIS!!</h2>
<h3>11-X*: Heracles but every enclosed shape is missing one edge</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Landmine Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> LANDMINE XI REMOVE</p>
<p>Every polygon has one side removed. Squares become triangles and so on. The inverse of XH Crab curse</p>
<h3>XR-Y: Rose Garden but each 90° tile should have a triangle</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> TRightangle</p>
<p>Specifically, a right angle triangle with the right angle "overlapping" with the original right angle. Right angles originally part of right triangles are unaffected</p>
<h3>XR-XC: Rose Garden but each triangle makes you more tired</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Crab Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> STriangler</p>
<p>Originally, STriangler made your BPM slow down whenever you hit a triangle. However, it seems that they got bored of making you fall asleep, so instead, the BPM speeds up</p>
<h3>XH-X*: Final Hope but every time you pass an n-gon, increase the speed by 0.01n times</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Landmine Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> LANDMINE H SPEED</p>
<p>Either the speed multiplier is increased by 0.01n (simple interest) or the BPM is multiplied by 1+0.01n (compound interest). In this case, it seems to be simple interest</p>

<h2>T3-8 - One-more-turn tiles!!</h2>
<h3>4-X*: Love Letters but when the angle is 90°, it is double</h3>
<p>You've already seen this one, so let's skip it.</p>
<h3>RJ-Y: Fear Grows but the multitaps has been changed to midspins</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> AkoChisa</p>
<p>I'm gonna have to explain the name, aren't I? Okay, so in my personal cursed levels, different BanG Dream characters are represented by different gimmicks, with Ako Udagawa being double tiles (as seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IzLsFjCv20">Third sun of darkness</a>) and Chisato Shirasagi being midspins. Hence, AkoChisa</p>
<h3>T2-EX: sing sing <a style="color:#f00">red</a> <a style="color:#00f">indigo</a> but the special midspins changes the planet counts</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> MidPlanetz</p>
<p>Paraphrased from Yangsy's website: Fire Midspin = Triple Planets, Ice Midspin = Double Planets, Star Midspin = Swap To Another Count For Planets.</p>

<h2>T3-9 - Answer!!</h2>
<h3>XC-XC: Credits but the twirls are missing</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Crab Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> NoTwirls</p>
<p>There aren't any twirls. The other option was Heracles but there's a twirl on every tile. As a tangent, when the section doesn't have any twirls, it just acts as 1-X Crab Curse</p>
<h3>[12-X]: Artificial Chariot but every 90° tile has a triangle, repeated ones don't</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Block Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> OnceTRightAngle</p>
<p>If there's a 90° tile, an equilateral triangle is added, UNLESS there are two or more 90° angles in a row</p>

<h2>T3-10 - S!!</h2>
<h3>XT-Y: Options but all the straight tiles are missing</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Straightn't</p>
<p>Unlike in 8-X Carrot curse of 4-XXX, the planets will skip them, rather than waiting.</p>
<h3>XF-Y: Third Wave Flip Flop but you take the shortcut</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Dream</p>
<p>Get it? Because Dream is a speedrunner? Anyways, if the center of two (or more) tiles overlaps with each other, the planets will choose the shortest path (in time, not in tile count) to walk on.</p>


<h2>T3-11 - Twisting Floors!!</h2>
<h3>3-X*: THE WIND UP but when the radian is nπ/4 (inner circle, n∈{1,2,3}), there is a hold</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Landmine Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> LANDMINE III HOLE</p>
<p>Holds on every 45°, 90° and 135° angle</p>
<h3>7-Y: Spin 2 Win but the angled tiles can modify the bpm using its time effect negatively</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Speedangle</p>
<p>&lt;180° = Speed Down, &gt;180° = Speed Up.</p>
<h3>T1-EX*: NEW LIFE but each long strip you pass will make you more tired</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Landmine Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> LANDMINE T1 SLEEPHOLD</p>
<p>Longstrip = hold, so it decreases your BpM more</p>
<h3>T1-EY: NEW LIFE but every hold is one turn longer</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Otherloop</p>
<p>Add 1 extra loops to every hold. Apparently you can also add holds if there aren't any</p>


<h2>T3-12 - Options jumpscare!!</h2>
<p>2:34 options jumpscare</p>
<h3>4-XC: Love Letters but I keep having Nightmares to Classic pursuit</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Crab Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Night</p>
<p>You suddenly jump to a different level, in this case XT-6</p>
<h3>5-XC: The Midnight Train but something's wrong with the train</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Crab Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Mr Wrong</p>
<p>The planets are in the wrong orientation. So e.g. 90° becomes 270° angles</p>
<h3>"XO-1": U-turn Road but all the existence states of swirls on u-turns are inverted</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Utwirl</p>
<p>There isn't really a way for me to add a Y in there so this is what you're getting. For each 360° tiles, if there is no swirl on it, add one; otherwise remove the swirl.</p>
<h3>XR-X*: Rose Garden but each rotation changes the number of planets
</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Landmine Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> LANDMINE R THREE BODY</p>
<p>If clockwise, 2 planets. If counter-clockwise, 3 planets. In the second state, it cancels out the 5-X Crab curse</p>

<h2>T3-14 - The *real* Speedy Floors!!</h2>
<h3>7-XC: Spin 2 Win but there's no fun allowed</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Crab Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Unfun</p>
<p>Each tile takes the same amount of time, as if every tile is a 180°</p>
<h3>MO-Y: EMOMOMO but ut after you meet a tile thats &gt;180° the speed should be doubled compared to tiles &lt;180°</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Fast Reflex</p>
<p>When you hit a tile which its angle is &gt;180°, your current speed will be doubled for once, until you hit a tile which its angle is &lt;180°, which will halved your current speed for once, until you hit a tile which its angle is >180°, which will doubled your current speed for once, until you... I think you get the idea</p>

<h2>T3-15 - Pausing Floors!!</h2>
<h3>PA-X: Distance but the midspins are taking over this level</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Midspinz 2.0</p>
<p>From the webstie (Again): Replace some non-midspin tiles to midspin, without changing the rhythm.</p>
<h3>RJ<a style="color:#F00">+</a>Y: Fear Grows but the midspins has been changed to multitaps</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Chisako</p>
<p><b>Edited from:</b> The multitaps has been changed to midspins</p>
<p>Now Chisato's the top... Actually, I wouldn't call the one whose gimmick is replaced the top</p>
<h3>[RJ-X]: Fear Grows instead of Multitap, there is a pause of one bit</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Block Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> AkoNana</p>
<p>Nanami Hiromachi = Pause. Basically the multitaps are replaced with one bit pauses, so this entire thing basically removes some tiles and places a pause on the preceding tile</p>

<h2>T3-16 - Answer!! Again!!</h2>
<h3>10<a style="color:#F00">+</a>X: There are some tiles that its angle is bigger than π radians</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Voluntary Reflex</p>
<p><b>Edited from:</b> There is no more tiles that its angle is bigger than π radians</p>
<p>This part kind of has an error. In the level, it reads "10-X", but this seems to be the curse it it actually. Anyways, if all the angles in the chart is less than 180°, then you can remove and place twirls wherever you want. The other option was "Credits but the level is made of pure tutorial"</p>


<h2>T3-17 - ...WHAT THE (deleted) (deleted) (deleted) HECK??!?!!</h2>
<h3>2-XC: Offbeats but it's a little longer</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Crab Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Longer I</p>
<p>Longer...</p>
<h3>XH<a style="color:#F00">+</a>Y: Final Hope but I didn't pay the DLC</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Deleted Level Curse</p>
<p><b>Edited from:</b> This is a DLC level</p>
<p>Oops, no DLC</p>
<h3>6-XC: PULSE but every time it goes up or down it gets faster</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Crab Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> TACHYCARDIA</p>
<p>It gets faster. These three are the initial curses of the level before more curses gets added</p>
<h3>4-EX*: Love Letters (Kotdari Remix) but when the angle is a specific angle, it is double-pressed.</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Landmine Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> LANDMINE IV-E DOUBLE V2</p>
<p>Same as it's non-EX counterpart but with a different angle which is stated, in this case, 360°.</p>
<h3>4-EX*: Love Letters (Kotdari Remix) but when the angle is a specific angle, it is double-pressed.</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Landmine Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> LANDMINE IV-E DOUBLE V2</p>
<p>Same as it's non-EX counterpart but with a different angle which is stated, in this case, 360°.</p>
<h3>RJ-Y: Fear Grows but the multitaps has been changed to midspins</h3>
<p>Now the uturns become a tile with a midspin</p>
<h3>T2-X*: sing sing <a style="color:#f00">red</a> <a style="color:#00f">indigo</a> but midspin turns into a hairpin.</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Landmine Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> LANDMINE T2 MID TURNS V2</p>
<p>Midspins turn into u-turns. With these three curses, the overhang thing has effectively got longer by one tile. This continues over and over and over while getting faster and faster</p>

<h2>T3-19 - Tricky Trialgens... nvm we have to slow down</h2>
<h3>XR<a style="color:#F00">+</a>XC: Rose Garden but each triangle makes you more excited</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Crab Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> STriangled</p>
<p><b>Edited from:</b> Each triangle makes you more tired</p>
<p>Supposedly, the BPM speeds up whenever a triangle hits, but this is STriangler we're talking about, so it slows down</p>

<h2>T3-20 - Almost there! Don't get distracted</h2>
<h3>"XO-2": Back-to-back Loops but all the existence states of swirls on 180° tiles are inverted</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> STwirl</p>
<p>Same as XO-1, but it's for 180°</p>
<h3>11-XAZC: Heracles but the Twirl tiles are multitaps</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Miss Qing Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Two Hit Twirls</p>
<p>What it says on the tin. Now there's a double tap on every tile in this long stretch, more or less</p>
<h3>3-XXX: Forward! Forward! Forward!</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> XXX Curse</p>
<p>All tiles that originally pointed left now point right</p>
<h3>[2-X]: Offbeats but somewhere in short</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Block Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Shorter II</p>
<p>Some lengths of lines are shorter</p>

<h2>End</h2>
<h3>XR-XC: Rose Garden but each triangle makes you more tired</h3>
<h3>XH-XC: Final Hope but every enclosed shape has an additional side</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> Crab Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> POLYGON</p>
<p>Every polygon has one side added. Squares become pentagons and so on. After that, it is applied twice so the squares become hexagons instead</p>
<h3>4-Y: Love Letters but short</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Shorter I</p>
<p>Inverse of 2-X Crab Curse. Skips the warp tiles+defend the castle part of the ending</p>
<h3>12-Y: Artificial Chariot but the acute angles and the obtuse angles are swapped</h3>
<p>Remember the hexagons brought about applying the XH Crab Curse twice? They're now two triangles, and the XH Crab Curse is applied two more times resulting in octagrams</p>
<h3>XF-Y: Third Wave Flip Flop but you take the shortcut</h3>
<h3>XH-X*: Final Hope but every time you pass an n-gon, increase the speed by 0.01n times</h3>
<h3>XC-Y: Credits but it's made of pure tutorial</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Toriel</p>
<p>Replaces a part of a level with it's corresponding tutorial. Or any tutorial for that matter</p>
<h3>XC<a style="color:#F00">+</a>Y: Credits but it's the main level</h3>
<p><b>Type:</b> String Curse</p>
<p><b>Personal Curse Name:</b> Asriel</p>
<p><b>Edited from:</b> It's made of pure tutorial</p>
<p>Undoes the previous curse, it doesn't have to be the same level the tutorial is from, but it is. It is used to repeat that end bit an absurd amount of times</p>

<br>
<p>And we're done!</p>
